# passwordGenerator

The goal of this project was to prompt the user to choose a password length betweem 8-128 characters, then have them confirm whther or not they would like to use numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or special characters. From there we would create arrays and use if/else statements to return different results for different conditions. Then on to developing functions that would generate random picks from the different arrays chosen by the user. These would have to be stored in a string and sent as the new rnadom passowrd to the browser for the user. This is a very pertinent application, with security issues and fraud being so prevalent these days. It would be an easy component to add to a clients browser, particularly for sensitive input information such as with banking logins.

My knowledge of the javascript basics(arrays, functions, for loops, conditional statements, etc.) is progressing as indiviual components. When attempting to start an application with a precise flow from scratch as javascript demands proves much more difficult for me. Knowing where to reference what in my for loop logic to create a certain outcome is the toughest as of yet. As much of a challnge as this was, the gratification of seeing a functioning application is worth it.
